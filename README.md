<h3>Wiki Country â€“ Developed a web-based application using React, React Router Dom, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to search for any country in the world and retrieve information about its population, capital, currency, and more. The application utilizes the REST Countries API to retrieve country data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Users can also filter countries by region, save countries as favorites, and view detailed information about each country. The application also includes a night mode feature that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. React Router Dom is used to handle routing and display different components based on the user's interactions with the application. The application is fully responsive and can be used on any device. I deployed the application using netlify </h3>
